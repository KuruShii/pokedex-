# Pokedex Project
---
A quick little project I wipped up after discovering [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/). This was made just a month into my coding venture with codecademy so excuse the code if its clunky and slow.
Currently the website can: 
+ Choose a pokemon game from the pokemon game series to check through
+ Return the basic pokemon info with a cute little icon 
+ Scroll through their possible types and abilities
+ Throw an error screen if u enter a pokemon that doesnt exist in that game or at all

Thanks for reading my really bad read me Kuru :3
